## Project Overview <a name = "description"></a>
ChessKey is a web application I created to solve an issue myself and many of my chess-addicted friends had: the ability to quickly create a shareable link to a chess game without the need to login to any of the popular chess sites. That's exactly what ChessKey is! Similar to yellkey.com, ChessKey allows users to create a short and shareable link which initializes a chess match with whoever visits the link first.
